# BRANCH & MAIN OFFICE INFRASTRUCTURE CISCO PACKET TRACER
This project implements a comprehensive network infrastructure connecting a Main Office and a Branch Office, utilising Cisco routers, switches, VLANs, DHCP services, and OSPF dynamic routing. 

---
## The goal was to: 
 - Segment networks using VLANs 
 - Implement Inter-VLAN routing 
 - Provide DHCP for each department 
 - Establish a WAN for connectivity between offices 
 - Enable routing using OSPF 
 - Ensure full end-to-end connectivity 

---
## Scope of Work:  
- Design and document a complete network infrastructure for both the Main Office and Branch Office.
- Configure VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, and subnetting as required by the network structure.
- Establish WAN connectivity between the Main and Branch offices using serial links.
- Implement and verify OSPF routing for dynamic route exchange.
- Configure DHCP (if required), static addressing, and interface setups across all routers and switches.
- Develop clear network topology diagrams for understanding and presentation.
- Provide fully documented IP addressing tables, device configurations, and routing tables.
- Ensure proper testing of end-to-end connectivity, including ping, routing verification, and fail-checks.
- Produce a finalised professional project report summarising design decisions, configurations, and outcomes.

## Network Requirements: 
The network is built based on the following requirements: 
 
- Functional Requirements 
 - Multiple departments requiring separation (HR, IT, Finance, Management). 
 - Ability to communicate across VLANs. 
 - Inter‑branch communication via routers. 
 - Support for servers hosted in the main office.
